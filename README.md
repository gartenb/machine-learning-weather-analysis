#### __Using Machine Learning Techniques to Analyze Weather Data__

## __Contents__<br>
__Files__<br>
- map_clustering.ipynb : analyzes event groups using clustering.<br>
- map\_svc.ipynb : builds on 'map_clustering.ipynb', and adds support vector machines<br>
- decision\_tree_numeric.ipynb : uses decision trees to find the most important factors in determining the root node (variable 'root\_node'). Only analyzes numeric attributes.<br>
- decision\_tree\_all.ipynb : similar to 'decision\_tree_numeric.ipynb', except it uses both categorical and numeric values.<br>

__Folders__<br>
- Tree Visuals : has the ".dot" files and their respective images generated by both decision tree files<br>
- Data : contains the weather data used*<br>
- usmap : contains the shapefiles for drawing the continental US*

* All weather data (in 'Data' folder) was obtained from:<br>
** The US map shapefiles (in 'usmap' folder) was retrieved from:<br>

Note: Weather data was truncated so they could be uploaded to GitHub
