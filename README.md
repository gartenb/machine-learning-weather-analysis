## __Using Machine Learning Techniques to Analyze Weather Data__

__Files__<br>
- [map_clustering.ipynb](https://github.com/gartenb/machine-learning-weather-analysis/blob/master/map_clustering.ipynb) : analyzes event groups using clustering.<br>
- [map\_svc.ipynb](https://github.com/gartenb/machine-learning-weather-analysis/blob/master/map_svc.ipynb) : builds on 'map_clustering.ipynb', and adds support vector machines<br>
- [decision\_tree_numeric.ipynb](https://github.com/gartenb/machine-learning-weather-analysis/blob/master/decision_tree_numeric.ipynb) : uses decision trees to find the most important factors in determining the root node (variable 'root\_node'). Only analyzes numeric attributes.<br>
- [decision\_tree\_all.ipynb](https://github.com/gartenb/machine-learning-weather-analysis/blob/master/decision_tree_all.ipynb) : similar to 'decision\_tree_numeric.ipynb', except uses both categorical and numeric values.<br>

__Folders__<br>
- Tree Visuals : has the ".dot" files and their respective images generated by both decision tree files<br>
- Data : contains the weather data used\*<br>
- usmap : contains the shapefiles for drawing the continental US\*\*

\* All weather data ('Data' folder) was obtained from: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/ncdc-storm-events-database/resource/591ca36e-14c1-4bcf-b5fd-fc2f52afd13e?inner_span=True<br>
\*\* US map shapefiles ('usmap' folder) was retrieved from: https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html<br>

Note: Weather data was truncated so it could be uploaded to GitHub
